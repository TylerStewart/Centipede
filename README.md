# Centipede

Recreation of the classic arcade game, Centipede.  Its far from finished. Assignment deadlines will do that to you.

A lot of this needs cleanup.  There is commented-out code snippets and bad practices littered throughout. It started as a 
student assignment consisting of weekly sprints with rigid goals, so the tech debt was never paid.  Talk about a hard lesson
in learning from your mistakes.
